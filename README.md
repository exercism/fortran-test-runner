# Exercism Fortran Test Runner

Docker image used for automatic testing of the Fortran track's exercises.

This test runner, much like the ones for other tracks, **must** respect the [specified interface][test-runner-interface].

Since the test runners are deployed as Docker images the [related specification][test-runner-docker] **must** be respected for the Dockerfile.

# Running tests

To run tests:

1. Open project's root in terminal
2. Run `./test.sh`

This will compile and run tests for all exercises in the `tests` folder, it will fail if the output file `result.json` is different from the expected one for the exercise.

If you want to run specific tests:

1. Open project's root in terminal
2. Run `./test.sh <EXERCISE_SLUG_1> <EXERCISE_SLUG_2>`

In both cases you can show more informations, like Docker output, by using the flag `-v` or `--verbose`.

# How it works

On the Fortran track we use CMake for building the exercises.
